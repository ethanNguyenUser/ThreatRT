To run the experiment, open PsychoPy/ThreatRT Protocol.py in PscyhoPy. You can install PsychoPy [here](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html). Once you open ThreatRT Protocol.py in PsychoPy, click the green play button toward the top to run the code and enter your full name before starting the experiment. Follow the text instructions, and take a rough note of how far away you are from your screen in cm. There are 150 trials total, so the protocol should take about 10 minutes to complete

We were initially going to do the experiment in VR, but we decided to just code up the project in PsychoPy as an initial test trial
