We were initially going to do the experiment in VR, but we decided to just code up the project in PsychoPy as an initial test trial

## How to Run Experiment 1
1. First, clone this repository using Github Desktop into a local folder of your choice.
2. Then, to run the experiment, open ThreatRT/PsychoPy/ThreatRT Protocol.py in PscyhoPy. You can install PsychoPy [here](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html).
3. Once you open ThreatRT Protocol.py in PsychoPy, click the green play button toward the top to run the code and enter your full name before starting the experiment
4. Take a rough note of how far away you are from your screen in cm and which monitor you're using
5. Follow the text instructions. There are 150 trials total, so the protocol should take about 10 minutes to complete.
6. After the experiment, the data should be saved as a .csv file in ThreatRT/PsychoPy/Data in your local folder. Check this is the case
7. Now, using Github Desktop, fetch from this Github repo and then commit and push to your changes (the added data file)
8. Check on the Github website that the changes are reflected online

## How to Run Experimen 2
1. First, clone this repository using Github Desktop into a local folder of your choice.
2. Then, make sure you have the VR headset if you'd like to take data in VR. If you're just testing, skip steps 3-4
3. Download Unity Hub/Unity
4. Add ThreatRT Experimient Key Change as a project
5. Select 2021.3.32f1 as the editor version
6. Open ThreatRT Experiment Key Change in Unity
7. Double click OutdoorScene.unity in the project area to open the scene
8. Click the play button toward the top of the screen to run the experiment
